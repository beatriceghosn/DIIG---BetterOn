# Duke Impact Investing Group - Client: BetterOn

Duke Impact Investing Group serves as a team of data analysts, helping to solve our client's problems with data-driven solutions. 
BetterOn is a professional development platform with bootcamps and coaching services dedicated to empowering powerful digital presence. 
My team of data analysts created a Python script to generate transcripts of users' speeches in order to make progress trackable and provide actionable insights on their communication skills. By analyzing these transcripts, we were able to identify key areas for improvement, such as tone, pacing, and word choice, and deliver personalized feedback to enhance users' digital presence. This data-driven approach allows BetterOn to offer tailored coaching solutions, ensuring measurable improvements in participants' performance over time.

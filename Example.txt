      think about how much time you spend communicating persuading trying to share your ideas with people you work with 
      sometimes in person sometimes virtually a lot more virtually now than what we were experiencing three years ago 
      it's not a skill that comes naturally it's something that we can all practice at that we can all get better at 
      and that's what I learned working with better on that there was Limitless possibility that I could access and myself if I just learned how to practice 
      and I just learned how to tap in to that inner energy and I learn how to convey my ideas beautifully on screen 
      and I'm still learning I'm still a student but I can look at who I was two years ago when I met better on and who I am now on screen
